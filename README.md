# Todo App:
# -----------

    First thing to do when developing an app is working out requirements and try to model your app before you start coding

## Requirements:

    - Use OOPs
    - Use Local Storage
    - CRUD Tasks
    - Use dates for tasks
    - Sort Alphabetically
    - Add "complete task" functionality
    - Refresh task list when App is closed and reopened

## Break down tasks:

    The next step is to break down the main requirements into physical code that we can write to achieve the requirements

    This may seem like an abstract way of doing things, but that is the essentially the point, since this methodology can be 
    applied to any real world app, not specifically a todo list

## Tips;

    Instead of focusing on the DOM aspect, try to get a somewhat functioning JavaScript application before making use of the 
    DOM API for simplification

    Another tip you can use is instead of attempting to create a function that encompasses one whole set of functionality, maybe
    break it up into smaller features and join them together as part of your refactoring/refining of your app
    eg: Create a button that refreshes your list / create test tasks and check if strikeout feature works etc.

    - Arrays
    - Traversing Array (using Loops)

### Functions
    - function parameters/arguements
    - 1 main functionality per function
    - Date/Time API
